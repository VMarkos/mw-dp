# Notes on Diversity Perception Experiments

## Structure of the study
1. Each participant is shown a set of 20 questions/tasks;
2. Tasks are split into two groups of 10, each one belonging to one of two conditions;
3. Prior to each group of tasks, each participant is shown a walkthrough, which prompts them to navigate throughout the process of that task.

## Materials
Various study materials.

### Demo texts
[x] **Constructed, unknown population**: You are requested to construct a (ranked/unranked) sample of 12 items, each belonging to one of the five (5) classes shown right. Add an item to the sample by clicking on its class (sample items are removed by simply clicking on them);
[x] **Constructed, known ranked/unranked population**: You are requested to construct a (ranked/unranked) sample of 12 items, drawing each item from the ranked/unranked population shown right. Add an item to the sample by clicking on it (sample items are removed by simply clicking on them);
[x] **Observed, known ranked/unranked population**: How diverse would you consider the (ranked/unranked) sample shown...

## TODOs
